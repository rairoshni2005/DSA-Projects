📚 DSA_Projects – Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository contains implementations of core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) as outlined in our academic lab manual. Each module is designed to provide a practical, hands-on understanding of foundational DSA concepts using the C programming language.

🧩 Modules Included
🧮 Array Operations
Insertion, deletion, and searching operations
Menu-driven interface for interactive learning

🗃️ Stack ADT
Using Arrays: Stack operations implemented with static memory allocation
Infix to Postfix Conversion: Utilizes the stack to convert expressions
Postfix Evaluation: Evaluates postfix expressions using stack logic
Using Linked List: Stack implementation with dynamic memory

📊 Queue ADT
Linear Queue (Array-based)
Circular Queue (Array-based)
Linear Queue (Linked List-based)

🔗 Linked Lists
Singly Linked List
Circular Linked List

🌲 Binary Search Tree (BST)
BST operations implemented using a linked list-based node structure

🌐 Graphs
Graph representation using adjacency matrix or list
Depth First Search (DFS)
Breadth First Search (BFS)

🔍 Searching & Sorting
Binary Search: Efficient search on sorted arrays
Bubble Sort: Sort elements in ascending/descending order
