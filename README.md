# Sem-2_Sprint-1_DSA_Projects

Data Structures and Algorithms Project
This repository contains implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) as outlined in the lab manual. Each module is designed to provide a hands-on understanding of fundamental DSA concepts.

Modules Included:
Array Operations

Implements basic operations on arrays like insertion, deletion, searching, etc. through a menu-driven program.
Stack ADT using Array

Implements Stack Abstract Data Type (ADT) using arrays.
Infix to Postfix Conversion

Converts an infix expression to postfix expression using the Stack ADT.
Evaluation of Postfix Expression

Evaluates a postfix expression using the Stack ADT.
Linear Queue ADT using Array

Implements Linear Queue ADT using arrays.
Circular Queue ADT using Array

Implements Circular Queue ADT using arrays.
Singly Linked List ADT

Implements Singly Linked List ADT.
Circular Linked List ADT

Implements Circular Linked List ADT.
Stack ADT using Linked List

Implements Stack ADT using Linked List.
Linear Queue ADT using Linked List

Implements Linear Queue ADT using Linked List.
Binary Search Tree ADT using Linked List

Implements Binary Search Tree ADT using Linked List.
Graph Traversal Techniques

Implements Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithms for graph traversal.
Binary Search Algorithm

Implements the Binary Search algorithm to search for an element in an array.
Bubble Sort Algorithm

Implements the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort elements of an array in ascending and descending order.
How to Use:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the desired module.
Compile and run the respective source file.
Feel free to explore each module and experiment with different inputs to gain a better understanding of the concepts.
